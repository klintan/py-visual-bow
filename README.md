#py-visual-bow
Visual bag of words in Python and scikit-learn. A common technique (before deep learning) to do visual search.

This will prepare a range of images to be used for image search.

What could be done in the future to improve?
- Try out different features
- Try out different parameters on different features
- Try out vocabulary size
- Try out histogram equalization, of image, of the resulting histogram.
